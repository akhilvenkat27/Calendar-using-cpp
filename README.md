# Calendar-using-cpp
THIS IS THE INTERPRETATION OF CALENDAR USING C++.  
THE LOGIC IS SIMPLE JUST KEEP ON FINDING EACH WITH DAY%7.  

NOTE : FINDING FIRST DAY IS THE MAIN STEP TO DISPLAY CALENDAR.  
       AS PER GEORGIAN CALENDAR 01/01/01 IS CONSIDERED AS MONDAY.  
       JUST FROM THEN YOU CAN FIND TOTAL YEAR.
